 AI-based image captioning system that generates meaningful descriptions for images using deep
 learning.
 
 Implements CNN-RNN architecture, where CNN (e.g., InceptionV3) extracts image features
 and LSTM generates captions.
 
 Leverages BLEU score evaluation from NLTK to assess the accuracy and quality of generated
 captions.
 
 Includes data augmentation and image embedding techniques to improve model robustness.
 
 Implementation of AI Agent for describing about the image in an echo form.
 
 Achieves high captioning accuracy, outperforming traditional rule-based captioning methods.
 
 Can be expanded for real-time applications like assistive technology for visually impaired users,
 automated content tagging, and AI-driven storytelling.
